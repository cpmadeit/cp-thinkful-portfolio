        <h3>This Is Me</h3>
        <p>Hello, I'm Cassie! I currently work part-time at Starbucks while completing 
          Thinkful's Engineering Flex program. I live with my wife, Kelly, in a little suburb 
          of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.</p> 
        
        <p>Outside of school and work, I love: </P>

        <h3>This Is What I Do</h3>
        <p>As a freshman in college, I had no idea what I wanted to do for a career and even less of an idea on how to figure that out.
        I ended up pursuing degrees in History and Museum Studies and then working at Starbucks after graduation, still not knowing what I might like to do for a job. 
        While the Covid-19 pandemic has been difficult and tragic in many ways, I took it as an opportunity to pause my current work life and really explore 
        what I want to do and what might make me happy.</p> 
        
        <p>Since taking an HTML-focused computer class in highschool, I have always had an interest in coding and technology but never felt 
        like it was a career option. At the beginning of the pandemic, while Starbucks' across the country were shutdown, I did some reasearch 
        and took some free online courses that reinforced my interest in these areas and pushed me in the 
        direction of a career move into a technology based field. In my research I found <a href="https://www.thinkful.com/">Thinkful</a>. This program is allowing
        me to do something I never thought I would be able to do again. I am loving this opportunity to learn a new and challenging skillset in a field that I enjoy 
        and aspire to use in the future to make some positive contribution to society.</p>
