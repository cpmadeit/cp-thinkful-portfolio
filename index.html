        <h3>This Is Me</h3>
        <p>Hello, I'm Cassie! I currently work part-time at Starbucks while completing 
          Thinkful's Engineering Flex program. I live with my wife, Kelly, in a little suburb 
          of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Outside of school and work, I love spending time with 
          our families, especially our nieces and nephew. I also enjoy reading and crafting 
          in my spare time and have recently really gotten into running virtual 5ks with Kelly. </p>

        <h3>This What I Do</h3>
        <p>As a freshman in college, I had no idea what I wanted to do for a career and even less of an idea on how to figure that out.
        I ended up pursuing degrees in History and Museum Studies and then working at Starbucks after graduation, still not knowing what I
        might like to do for a job. While the Covid-19 pandemic has been difficult and tragic in many ways, I took it as an opportunity to pause 
        my current work life and really explore what I want to do and what might make happy. In my research I found <a href="https://www.thinkful.com/">Thinkful</a>. This program is
        allowing me to do something I never thought I would be able to do again. I am learning a new skillset in my own time and affordably.</p>
